1_1: 
<通常>Okay!
Now I'll start with
the rules!

2_1: 
<通常>The goo-al of Fortune
Street is to get RICH!

3_1: 
<通常>First each player rolls
the dice and advances that number.

4_1: 
<通常>It's up to you which way to goo
first, but I'll goo right this time.

5_1: 
<通常>Choose the direction when
arrows appear at forks in the road.

6_1: 
<通常>If you stop at 【？】,
you can pick a Chance Card.

7_1: 
<通常>What happens depends on what
card you draw!

8_1: 
<通常>And what's more, you can pick
a chance card even when you get a
suit!

9_1: 
<通常>A suit is one of a
Spade　　　　　　　　　　


10_1: 
A suit is one of a
Spade, Heart　　　　　　


11_1: 
A suit is one of a
Spade, Heart, Clover


12_1: 
A suit is one of a
Spade, Heart, Clover,
or Diamond.

13_1: 
<通常>You'll get income once
you collect them all and visit
the bank. What lucky symbols!

14_1: 
<通常>Next take a look at the
bottom-left!

15_1: 
<通常>On the entire map,
you'll know where everyone's

16_1: 
<通常>shops are, and where everyone
else is at a goo-lance.

17_1: 
<通常>Next take a look at the
bottom-right. It will show your
total gold and total assets.

18_1: 
<通常>Left is your gold,　

19_1: 
<通常>and right is your total assets.

20_1: 
<通常>Your total assets are the
sum of your gold, shares, and
value of your shops.

21_1: 
<通常>You win when you reach the
bank and your assets meet the goo-al!

22_1: 
<通常>Also the game will end when
someone bankrupts. Then the
wealthiest player wins.

23_1: 
<通常>That's the gist of it.
If there's anything unclear,
come by and ask me any time!

24_1: 
<通常>I'll teach you how to buy shops!
I'll only tell you once so
listen up!

25_1: 
<通常>You can buy unowned shops
at cost when you stop at them.

26_1: 
<通常>The cost is the number
above it.

27_1: 
<通常>But you won't see that
number when you've bought
the shop.

28_1: 
<通常>The cost for someone to
stay at a shop is the number
below.

29_1: 
<通常>You'll receive a fee
when other people stop at
your shops.

30_1: 
<通常>But conversely, you'll
pay a fee when you stop at
someone else's shop.

31_1: 
<通常>Also you can remodel when
when you stop at your own shop.

32_1: 
<通常>Remodel means spending
money and making your shop
larger.

33_1: 
<通常>You'll get more money
when you invest.


34_1: 
<通常>Now that I've taught you
about shops, next I'll teach
you about areas.

35_1: 
<通常>An area is a collection of
several shops near each other.


36_1: 
<通常>This shop……

37_1: 
<通常>And this shop……

38_1: 
<通常>And this shop……

39_1: 
<通常>And finally this shop
are in the same area.

40_1: 
<通常>In other words, shops of
the same color make up an area.

41_1: 
<通常>It is very good if you
can buy several shops in the same
area!

42_1: 
<通常>The money you can invest
steadily increases, and you'll
be a-slurp with cash soon enough!

43_1: 
<通常>You'll be really flush
if you can buy ALL shops in an
area!

44_1: 
<通常>Depending on the map,
there are vacant lots that
don't have any cost.

45_1: 
<通常>What is built on a
vacant lot is decided by
whomever buys it.

46_1: 
<通常>You can even build things
other than shops so goooo ahead
and give it a try.

47_1: 
<通常>I'll teach you about the
really important shares in this game.

48_1: 
<通常>You can become a shareholder of
any area that you want when you buy shares.

49_1: 
<通常>You have a variety of
advantages as a shareholder.

50_1: 
<通常>First you can earn income
in an area even when it's not your
own shop!

51_1: 
<通常>Oh, and what's more!
The share price of an area gooes
up as the shops get bigger.

52_1: 
<通常>To sum it up, you'll be
a king slime before you know it
when you hold shares!

53_1: 
<通常>Okay, I'll teach you a
trick about shares now.

54_1: 
<通常>Buy 10 or more shares
at a time when you buy.

55_1: 
<通常>When you do that,

56_1: 
<通常>the share price will go
up by 7%.

57_1: 
<通常>Conversely, when you sell
10 or more,

58_1: 
<通常>the share price drops by 7%.

59_1: 
<通常>You wouldn't want to cut your
own share price, right? So sell 9
or less!

60_1: 
<通常>On the other hand, for areas
that your opponents have lots of shares,

61_1: 
<通常>selling 10 or more shares to
drop the share price
is one strategy.

62_1: 
<通常>Okay, so how do you goo
about getting a hold of these
shares, you ask?

63_1: 
<通常>You can buy them if you
land at the

64_1: 
<通常>stock broker or at the bank.

65_1: 
<通常>Buying it is simple.
At either place, press the
<アイコン:マル> button.

66_1: 
<通常>You can buy whatever
stock you please at either
place!

67_1: 
<通常>So now you too can
buy and sell shares like a pro.
Have fun!

68_1: 
<通常>Now I'll teach you a
sure-win strategy.

69_1: 
<通常>You'll get your chance to
make it big when you have lots
of shops in one area!

70_1: 
<通常>Buy lots of shares in that
area, and then remodel your
shops.

71_1: 
<通常>Oh, right, for example.
If you buy 99 shares more
in this area.

72_1: 
<通常>Then you'll have 198, no?

73_1: 
<通常>And when you spend 999G
to remodel the areas shops.

74_1: 
<通常>Are you looking or just
boinging around?
Watch closely!

75_1: 
<通常>See! You just made a
ton of money faster than a
liquid metal, no?

76_1: 
<通常>You'll be set if you set
your eyes on an area you can do
999G remodels on!

77_1: 
<通常>As you play, you'll find
times when you can't buy or get
a hold of shops.

78_1: 
<通常>In times like those,
look to buy shares in areas that
other players have shops.

79_1: 
<通常>For example, if you bought
shares in this area.

80_1: 
<通常>When it becomes their
turn.

81_1: 
<通常>And when the shop owner
earns lots of money.

82_1: 
<通常>BO-ING! Well didn't YOU just
make a bunch of money now?

83_1: 
<通常>This is called the piggyback
strategy.

84_1: 
<通常>Goo-t it? You can win if you
remember this strategy alone!

85_1: 
<通常>That's what I want to say,
but it's all up to you really.

86_1: 
<通常>Okay, now goo have fun!

87_1: 
<通常>Okay!
Now I'll explain EZ Mode!

88_1: 
<通常>EZ Mode is a quick way to
play with rules aimed at
newcomers.

89_1: 
<通常>It is much easier to
understand than Standard mode.

90_1: 
<通常>So, if you feel like
things are too hard, try playing
on EZ Mode!

91_1: 
<通常>That said, there are 3
big differences than with
Standard mode.

92_1: 
<通常>First, there are no
shares. And...


93_1: 
<通常>Second, there are no
area differences.

94_1: 
<通常>Third, with solo play,
you cannot change Vacancy
or selling rules

95_1: 
<通常>Doesn't it become simpler
without worrying about these
three things?

96_1: 
<通常>Okay, I'll goo into detail
about one last thing.

97_1: 
<通常>In EZ Mode,

98_1: 
<通常>Your shops will get bigger
when you own at least 2.

99_1: 
<通常>Your income will increase and
of course shop value increases a bit
too, so it's really goo-d!

100_1: 
※ Text won't be displayed here,
only demo contents will follow.

101_1: 
<通常>To sum it up, the are no
shares, so it's easy to get the
hang of buying and selling shops!

102_1: 
<通常>In any case, in EZ Mode,
there is less info for a player
to understand.

103_1: 
<通常>So first get the suits,
level up,
and goo get that bank cash!

104_1: 
<通常>And keep on buying shops
and connecting them together!

105_1: 
<通常>That's the gist of it,
so why don't you give it a try.

106_1: 
<通常>Once you've goo-t the hang
of EZ Mode, you should play
Solo Play.

107_1: 
<通常>And with that, I'm praying
for your hard work and goo-d
fortune!
